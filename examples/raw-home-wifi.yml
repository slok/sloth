# This example shows another less accurate or simpler way of creating the home wifi SLO.
#
# The metrics already give us a metric in ratio for each wifi connection satisfaction, instead of getting
# good and bad events as connection with a minimum satisfaction ratio, we will calculate the averate of all
# ratio satisfaction connections over the time window.
# So we can't use the `events` SLI because we are not going to divide bad and total events.
#
# - `wifi-client-satisfaction`
#   - This SLO warn us that we have an average wifi connection satisfaction.
#   - SLI error: Calculated internally by ubiquitis metrics, we use directly the ratio.
#   - SLO objective (95%): We allow the average wifi connection satisfaction is >=95%
#
# `sloth generate -i ./examples/raw-home-wifi.yml`
